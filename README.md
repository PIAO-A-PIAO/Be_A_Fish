# Inspiration
Water pollution is more and more serious now. This is not a solid solution to solve the water quality. Instead, we design the game to make more people be aware of the damage we do to the water system. With more people involved and motivated, the water system will be restored for sure.

# What it does
A web RPG game to show you how tough it is to survive as a fish. Play as a fish, pass four mini-games and try to survive in an open world.

# Built with
html+css+js(for the first time)

# Challenges we ran into
Since this is the first time we build a web game with javascript, there is a lot to learn about. Due to the time limit, only part of the code is completed.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
I love the idea of the game, especially the open world at the end. What players are going to play as is totally by chance, and the only goal here is to survive!

# What we learned
A lot of programming skills and game design knowledge for sure.
